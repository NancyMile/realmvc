            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by
            the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point
            of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
            distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content
            here', making it look like readable English.

            It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
            containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
            publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
            Ipsum.
